Save your files from each challenge in this folder.

To keep everything organized, please follow the file naming convention below:


FILES:

  This naming convention utilizes the version system often seen used by software companies.
You've probably seen this before. Consider Bobs Software company... Bob might name their
first set of software as GoBob. Later on down the road, after Bobs Software works out the
bugs and adds features, they might name it GoBob1.2 (short for GobBob Version 2).


For the coding problems you answer here, please save your files as such.

problem1.js (This would be the name of your FIRST solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Problem 1.)

problem1.2.js (This would be the name of your SECOND (i.e., better and optimized) solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Problem 1.)

problem2.js (This would be the name of your FIRST solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Problem 2.)

problem2.2.js (This would be the name of your SECOND (i.e., better and optimized) solution for the component that handles your JavaScript and JSX/HTML for Problem 2.)

etc. etc.


FOLDERS:

Or, save each problem into its own folder:

Problem1 (Which is a folder that would contain problem1.jsm, problem1.css, etc.)
Problem2 (Which is a folder that would contain it's own problem2.js, problem2.css etc.)

If you optimize a solution, a new folder would be created as follows:

Problem1.2 (Which is a folder that contains the optimized files for Problem 1, which should now be named problem1.2.js, problem1.2.css etc.)
